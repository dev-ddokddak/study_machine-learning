They'll hire you by giving you 2-3 positions hike but trust me it hardly creates any difference. You won't be able to justify a package of 5.5LPA at a position of Dy. Manager.
Good point is you can enhance your presentation skills here if you're in REF Factory.
My clear advice is to you is don't spend much time here because though it sounds like a OEM but in actual it us way poor than a vendor company.
People here are pressured and forced to a level where they've to leave job without having another job in hand.
